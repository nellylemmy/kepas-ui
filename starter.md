KEPAS Starter Presence Plan: The Complete Project Journey
Investment: KSh 30,000 (One-time Fee)

Welcome to KEPAS. We are excited to partner with you to build your professional online presence. This document outlines our clear, step-by-step process to get your new website live. Our goal is to make this journey smooth, transparent, and efficient.

Phase 1: Project Kick-off & Discovery (Week 1)
This initial phase is about setting a strong foundation for the project.

Service Agreement & Deposit:

We will send you a formal Service Agreement that outlines all the deliverables.

Alongside the agreement, you will receive an invoice for the 50% deposit (KSh 15,000) to officially commence the project. Payment can be made via M-Pesa PayBill, Bank Transfer, or Cheque.

Discovery Call (1 Hour):

We will schedule a call to understand your organization, your goals, and your target audience.

We will discuss the three key pages:

Home Page: The first impression. What is the most important message you want visitors to see?

About Us Page: Your story. What makes your organization unique?

Contact Us Page: How people can reach you.

We will also discuss your brand's look and feel (e.g., colors, style).

Content & Logo Collection:

You will provide us with the written text for the three pages and your official logo in a high-quality format. If you need help with writing, we can discuss our copywriting add-on service.

Phase 2: Design & Development (Week 1-2)
This is where we bring your vision to life.

Domain Name Registration:

We will secure your preferred website address (e.g., www.yourorganisation.co.ke), subject to availability. This is included in your package for the first year.

Website Hosting Setup:

We will set up a secure, reliable hosting account for your website. This is your website's home on the internet, and it's included for the first year.

Website Design & Build:

Our team will design and develop your 3-page website based on our discovery call.

We will ensure the design is clean, professional, and fully responsive, meaning it will look great on all devices (phones, tablets, and computers).

We will integrate your logo, content, and professional stock photos that match your brand.

Key Feature Integration:

Contact Details: Your phone number, email, and physical address will be clearly visible.

Google Map: We will embed an interactive map to your location on the Contact Us page.

WhatsApp Button: A clickable button will be added so visitors can message you directly.

Phase 3: Review & Launch (Week 3)
In this final phase, we'll review the website together and prepare for its official launch.

First Review:

We will provide you with a private link to view the complete website.

You will have the opportunity to review everything and provide one round of feedback for any minor changes to the text or images.

Final Revisions:

We will implement your requested changes promptly.

Final Invoice & Launch Approval:

Once you are happy with the website, we will send the final invoice for the remaining 50% balance (KSh 15,000).

Upon receipt of the final payment, we will prepare the website to go live.

Go-Live!

We will officially launch your website, making it public for the world to see on your new domain name. We handle all the technical steps.

Phase 4: Ongoing Partnership & Support (Optional)
A website is a living asset that needs care to remain effective. To ensure your site stays secure and up-to-date, we offer our affordable Peace of Mind support plan.
